## 📈 Key Steps & Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Exploration**
   - Loaded housing data using Python and SQL
   - Performed EDA to uncover patterns and data quality issues

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, removed outliers, normalized skewed features
   - Engineered new variables like price per square foot and total usable area

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained multiple regression models
   - Compared metrics: R² score, MAE, RMSE
   - Achieved **96.28% accuracy** with Gradient Boosting

4. **Dashboarding & Insight Delivery**
   - Built dashboards in Tableau & Power BI to display:
     - Regional pricing trends
     - Feature importance
     - Interactive filters (location, price range, etc.)
